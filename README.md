### Hey, I’m Rashmika Sharma 👋

I’m studying Computer Science with a focus on AI & ML. Still figuring things out, but excited about building, breaking, and learning from code.



#### 🔭 What I’m Working On  
Right now, I’m experimenting with small projects to get a better grip on how AI and machine learning actually work. Mostly building simple apps and playing around with basic algorithms — it’s all a bit chaotic but super fun 🤖✨

#### 🌱 What I’m Learning  
- Python (the learning curve is real 🐍)  
- Data structures and algorithms (not really a child's play 😅)  
- Basics of machine learning  
- Slowly getting the hang of GitHub and version control 😅  

#### 👯 Open to Collaborate On  
If you're also just starting out and want to work on something AI/ML-related — projects, mini hackathons, anything hands-on — I’m definitely in. Let’s figure things out together 🛠️

#### 🤔 Could Use Help With  
Turning theory into real code is tougher than I thought! Especially with ML — going from a lecture slide to an actual working model is a whole journey. So any tips or resources are always welcome 🙌

#### 💬 Ask Me About  
Learning to code from scratch or how I balance college with side projects 😉

#### 📫 Let’s Connect  
Feel free to reach out on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rashmika-sharma-9a8b72341) — I’m always happy to chat, especially with fellow students or tech enthusiasts!

#### 😄 Pronouns  
She / Her

#### ⚡ Fun Fact  
I got into coding thinking it’d be like solving fun little puzzles. And it is… except the puzzles yell at you with errors when you get them wrong 😅
